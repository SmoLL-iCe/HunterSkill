An external overlay experiment for MHW Iceborne.
With HP stats and distances for big monsters!

# See all!
Compare between you and other players, between dice attack have your averages and your worst attack!

![STATICS](https://github.com/SmoLL-iCe/HunterSkill/blob/main/MH/statics.png)


Follow the life of your hunt beyond your observation!
In addition to the signals themselves we set up an overlay for the monster, showing its maximum and current HP, with different colors to know if it is possible to capture, or if it is already close to death.
